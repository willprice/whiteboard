title: Technical constraints
---

# Mandatory

* javascript frontend
* javascript backend
* XHTML or HTML5 with validation
* Embedded database

# Strongly recommended

* Node server: express.js
* SQLite

# My choices

* js lang: ES6 (neeeed modules)
* testing framework: ava? Or just the usual jasmine/mocha/sinon stack?
  * Yeah, ava looks pretty good, the test output has really nice diffing
* If I use redux I'll get time travelling debugging which was one of the major attractions of elm
* framework: vue/react ?
* npm, make? Ideally make, deeper knowledge of make will be useful in future, it's never going away.
* webpack? Why do I need webpack? I'd like to avoid it if possible, does ES6 mitigate the need for it?
  * Webpack can do transformation from source files to targets (sounds like make...)
