## HTML5

### Notable features

These features might be of use

* *App cache* (Offline web apps): cache webpages/webapps for offline use, e.g.
  like devdocs.io
* *Canvas*: resolution dependent bitmap canvas
* *Canvas text*: Text rendering to canvas support
* *Local storage*: Store lots of information locally, instead of using cookies
  which get sent back to the server for each request
* *Web workers*: Run JS in the background (like threads)
* *Input types*: Lots of new input types for forms (tel, url, email, week etc)

* `rel="prefetch"` to specify resources that are almost certainly going to be
  used (e.g. on google for first result)
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<hgroup>`
* `<header>`
* `<footer>`
* `<footer>`
* Use outliner to check correct usage of `h*` tags: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/

## JS

* *Modernizr*: Detect HTML5 features, checkout caniuse.com to see whether this
  approach is worth the effort or whether browser support is sufficiently good
